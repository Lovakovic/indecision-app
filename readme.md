# Indecision app

This is a simple web application I made while completing the first part of React introduction course.
The main purpouse of the app was for me to get familiar with react concepts and test myself on applying them. You can also use the app if you as a coin flip when you can't decide between multiple options.

I will most likely deploy the app once I finish the course.
